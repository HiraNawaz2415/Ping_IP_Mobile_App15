# PingIP Address Mobile App

A mobile application that allows users to ping an IP address or domain to check its availability and network response time. The app provides a simple user interface for users to input an IP address or domain and displays the result, showing whether the target is reachable or not and the round-trip time.

## Project Description

The **PingIP Address Mobile App** enables users to check the availability of a target server or domain by sending a network ping request. Users can enter any valid IP address or domain (e.g., `8.8.8.8` or `www.google.com`) and get feedback on whether the server is reachable along with the round-trip time (ping latency). 

This app is useful for network diagnostics, testing server uptime, and ensuring network connectivity in real-time.

## Features

- **Ping an IP Address or Domain**: Enter any valid IP address or domain name to check connectivity.
- **Response Time**: Displays the time taken for the ping request to return from the target.
- **Status Indicator**: Tells the user whether the target IP address or domain is reachable.
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use user interface with input fields and buttons.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant feedback on the connection status and response time.
